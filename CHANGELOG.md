# Autotask Node SDK Release Notes

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Regular Time entry support** (`TimeTrackingClient.createRegularTimeEntry()`) — create non-ticket time entries for meetings, admin work, training, etc. with `timeEntryType=5` (Activity) set automatically
- **`TimeEntries.createDirect()`** — POST to `/TimeEntries` without parent scope, enabling Regular Time workflows
- **`CoreClient.searchResources()` / `resolveResourceByName()`** — search and resolve resources/technicians by full name with first/last split logic
- **`FinancialClient.getInternalBillingCodes()` / `resolveInternalBillingCodeByName()`** — fetch and resolve BillingCodes with `useType=3` (internal allocation codes: Internal Meeting, Training, PTO, etc.)

### Fixed

- **Better 500/5xx error messages** — `ServerError` now includes details from the `errors` array in Autotask API responses, making it much easier to debug server-side validation failures
- **Proper gzip compression** — requests with `enableCompression: true` now actually compress the body with gzip (previously the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header was set but the body was uncompressed, causing 500 errors on child entity endpoints)

### Notes (Autotask API discoveries)

- Regular Time entries require `internalBillingCodeID` (NOT `billingCodeID`)
- Only BillingCodes with `useType=3` are valid for Regular Time categories
- The API returns `{itemId: N}` for creates (not `{id: N}`) — handled automatically in `createRegularTimeEntry()`
- The Autotask error message references "InternallAllocationCodeID" (with typo) but the actual REST API field is `internalBillingCodeID`

## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **QuoteItems endpoint** — `create()` and `delete()` now use the correct parent-child URL `/Quotes/{id}/Items` instead of the top-level `/QuoteItems` endpoint

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `TicketNotes.create()` now requires `ticketId` as first parameter and POSTs to `/Tickets/{ticketId}/Notes`
- **BREAKING**: `ProjectNotes.create()` now requires `projectId` as first parameter and POSTs to `/Projects/{projectId}/Notes`
- **BREAKING**: `CompanyNotes.create()` now requires `companyId` as first parameter and POSTs to `/Companies/{companyId}/Notes`
- **BREAKING**: `TimeEntries.create()` now requires `ticketId` as first parameter and POSTs to `/Tickets/{ticketId}/TimeEntries`

### Fixed

- Child entity create endpoints now use correct parent-child URL patterns required by the Autotask REST API
- Updated metadata endpoints to reflect correct parent-child URLs

## [2.0.3] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- Removed `dotenv.config()` calls from library client classes (`AutotaskClient`, `EnhancedAutotaskClient`, and generated clients). Libraries should not load `.env` files — that is the consuming application's responsibility. This caused stdout pollution with dotenv v17+, breaking MCP servers and other stdio-based protocols.

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `xlsx` (SheetJS) with `exceljs` for Excel file parsing
  - xlsx had unfixed HIGH severity vulnerabilities (prototype pollution, ReDoS)
  - exceljs provides equivalent functionality with better security
- Fixed `qs` DoS vulnerability via arrayLimit bypass
- Updated dev dependencies: semantic-release, jest, typescript-eslint, prettier, ts-jest, winston, express

### Changed

- Package renamed to `@asachs01/autotask-node` (scoped)
- Package now published to GitHub Packages instead of npm
- Install with: `npm install @asachs01/autotask-node --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`

### Known Issues

- Remaining vulnerabilities are in dev/build tooling only (tar, diff) and do not affect the published package
